## Bluesky Letterboxd Bot

Posts your Letterboxd activity to Bluesky

The way I use Letterboxd is that as I start a film, I create a "watched" Diary entry so this bot can pick it up and send a "Now watching" post to Bluesky. If you use it differently, you may want to change the text that gets posted.

Future iterations will include additional activities:
- "Just reviewed"
- "Created a list"
